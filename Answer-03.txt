Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Answer: Loops or Iteration Statements in Programming are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds.

=> Loops, also known as iterative statements, are used when we need to execute a block of code repetitively. Loops in programming are control flow structures that enable the repeated execution of a set of instructions or code block as long as a specified condition is met. Loops are fundamental to the concept of iteration in programming, enhancing code efficiency, readability and promoting the reuse of code logic.

* Type of Loops: JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

(1) for - loops through a block of code a number of times
(2) while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
(3) do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


(1) for loop: The syntax of the for loop is:

for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body
}

Example: Print Numbers From 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

Output:
1
2
3
4
5

(2) while Loop: The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

The syntax of the while loop is:

while (condition) {
    // body of loop
}

Example: Display Numbers From 1 to 3
// initialize variable i
let i = 1;

// loop runs until i is less than 4
while (i < 4) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}

Output
1
2
3

(3) do...while Loop: The do...while loop executes a block of code once, then repeatedly executes it as long as the specified condition is true.

The syntax of the do...while loop is:

do {
    // body of loop
} while(condition);

Example: Display Numbers from 3 to 1
let i = 3;

// do...while loop
do {
    console.log(i);
    i--;
} while (i > 0);

Output:
3
